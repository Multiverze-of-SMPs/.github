# Multiverze of SMPs
The Multiverze of SMPs is a Minecraft Multi-server franchise where all of our hosted servers, share the same multiverse.
Those servers being:
- CAVESMP
- GGSMP
- MemeSMP Rising
- MemeSMP
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GGSMP, MemeSMP Rising & MemeSMP are all finished and won't get a renewed Season... for now... ;)

## CAVESMP
The CAVESMP is a private modded Minecraft server with storyline events set in the very same multiverse as the other servers.
This time, the members has the occasional to travel to other universes but only to defend them against multiversal threats.
The CAVESMP is currently in its 2nd Season and won't be with the list of ended servers very soon.

The CAVESMP has it's own GitHub Organization:
https://github.com/cavesmp

## GGSMP
The GGSMP, like the CAVESMP is also a private server (like any other server in the franchise) but is the last Vanilla like Minecraft server in the franchise.
It's the first server to have real factions (countries) where members can join or create.
It ended in it's First and only Season in 2022. A few months later, the CAVESMP has been created which shared most of its members from the GGSMP.

## MemeSMP Rising
The Rising server was for the MemeSMP to find new members to join the Main series but was later decanonized but still lives forth in the Multiverse.

## MemeSMP
The MemeSMP shared 2 seasons before ending definitely. It's the very first entry in the Multiverze of SMPs franchise.
There were only 4 real members of this SMP which shared a small little area in a otherwise huge overworld.

# How do I join the Multiverze of SMPs?
The Multiverze of SMPs hosts and creates private servers. Members of already finished or active servers can join newer server entries at any time requested (the CAVESMP follows a what different ruleset for inviting and joining the server, but it's still private).
